# Sabrina's Chat App
This app was codeded July-August 2019 by Sabrina Button for the purpose of learning how to use React, Express, and Socket.io.

Click on the link provided at the top of the repository to open the chat-app. If you are the first user on the app may take a while to load, be patient, try submitting a few messages and refresh. This is appears to be an issue with socket.io and hosting through two different sources for the backend and frontend... However, I am too lazy to fix this as this was project was programmed solely for learning purposes.

The client-side is hosted on [github pages](https://sabrinabutton.github.io/chat-app), and the backend is hosted via [heroku](https://sabrinas-chat-app.herokuapp.com/).
